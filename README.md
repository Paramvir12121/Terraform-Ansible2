## üåê Infrastructure Overview

- **Resource Group Module**: Sets up a resource group in Azure.
- **Network Module**: Configures the virtual network, subnet, and network security group.
- **Common Module**: Contains configurations for common services like storage accounts, log analytics workspaces, and recovery services vault.
- **Linux & Windows VM Modules**: Deploys Linux and Windows virtual machines respectively.
- **Datadisk Module**: Manages data disks attached to the VMs.
- **LoadBalancer Module**: Sets up a load balancer for the Linux VMs.
- **Database Module**: Configures a PostgreSQL database.

All configurations can be found in the `main.tf` file with each module having its dedicated configurations.

## ü§ñ Ansible Roles

The Ansible roles are designed to configure the resources post-deployment:

- **datadisk**: Creates partitions and mounts disks to VMs.
- **users**: Manages user creation on the deployed VMs.
- **webserver**: Sets up and configures an Apache web server.

Each role is structured according to Ansible best practices with tasks, handlers, files, and templates.
